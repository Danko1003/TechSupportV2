TechSupport - the DodgySoft Technical support system, version #2.

This project is part of the material for the book

   Objects First with Java - A Practical Introduction using BlueJ
   Seventh edition
   David J. Barnes and Michael KÃ¶lling

This project is discussed in chapter 6.


This project implements a second version of the technical support system 
example. It is an intermediate version intended to demonstrate the first
few changes discussed in this book chapter.


To start this program, create a SupportSystem object and execute the "start" 
method.

Then start describing your problem by typing in the terminal window.

    * `put(K key, V value)` 
    * `get(Object key)` 
    * `containsKey(Object key)` 
    * `containsValue(Object value)` 
    * `remove(Object key)` 
    * `replace(K key, V value)` 
    * `equals(Object o)` 
    * `hashCode()` 
    Yes



26-To check the number of entries in a map you can use the `size` method in most programming languages.
